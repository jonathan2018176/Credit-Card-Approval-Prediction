# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict credit card application approvals based on applicant features. It covers the full data science workflow including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – for numerical computing and array operations  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting and visualization  
- **Seaborn** – for statistical data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing

### Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw application data  
- Engineered features using encoding, scaling, and imputation techniques  
- Trained a logistic regression model to classify approvals  
- Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualized feature importance and key approval drivers

### Use Cases
- Understand key factors that influence credit card approval  
- Apply model outputs to assist in risk-based decision making  
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow from raw data to insights
