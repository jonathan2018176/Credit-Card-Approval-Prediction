# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

Overview
This project demonstrates the process of predicting credit card approval using a Logistic Regression model. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and seaborn. The goal is to predict whether a credit card application will be approved based on certain features. The dataset is provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this project:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Numerical computing and array operations.

matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.

seaborn: Statistical data visualization.

scikit-learn: Machine learning tools for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

Make sure to have the above libaries installed:
